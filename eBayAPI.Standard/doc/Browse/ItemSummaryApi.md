This call searches for eBay items by various URI query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN or a combination of these. The following are examples of using these parameters to limit the results: The following call returns 4,330,774 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone This call, which limits the results to the category &quot;Cell Phones &amp; Smartphones&quot;, returns 142,098 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=9355 These calls, which limit results to a Samsung Galaxy S5, returns 97 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220&amp;epid=182527490 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=182527490 Controlling what is returned You can also control what is returned by using the fieldgroups field. In addition to returning items, which is the default, you can return refinements (metadata) about an item that enables you to create aspect histograms. A histogram enables users to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. You can return: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by variation aspects, such as Brand, Color, etc. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by either FIXED_PRICE or AUCTION CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by items in a category CONDITION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by item condition, such as NEW, USED, etc. EXTENDED - Returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information. MATCHING_ITEMS - The default, which returns the items. When used with one or more of the refinement values above the specified refinements and all the matching items are returned. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Filtering by aspects You can use the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS returned to filter the result set using the aspect_filter field. For example: This call gets a list of the aspects pairs for the item and the dominant category (category most of the items are in). /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS This call filters the items by one of the aspect pairs returned and the dominant category. The category ID is required twice when using aspect_filter; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas} This call filters the items by multiple aspects /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas},Featured Refinements:{Adidas Match Ball} This call filters the items by multiple aspect values /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Fields filters There are also field filters you can use to refine the result set, such as listing format, item condition, price range, listing end date, location, and more. You can use multiple field filters in a single call. For a list and details of the supported filters, see search Call Field Filters. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls ( limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this call Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. Restrictions This call can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions. URL Encoding Parameters and Headers As with all query parameter values, the filter parameter value and request header values must be URL encoded. For better readability, the examples in this document omit the encoding. Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Encoded Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId%3A20863%2CBrand%3A%7BNike%7CWilson%7D For more information about encoding, see HTML URL Encoding Reference.

            Configuration.Default.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new ItemSummaryApi();
            var aspectFilter = aspectFilter_example;  // string | This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. For example, the call below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=15724&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/AspectFilter.html (optional) 
            var categoryIds = categoryIds_example;  // string | The category ID is used to limit the results. This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792 Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category ID. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids, epid, and q fields. This gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for &quot;phone&quot;, the result set will be mobile phones because this is the &quot;Best Match&quot; for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Submit the following call to get the dominantCategoryId for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=keyword&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. Required: The call must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these) (optional) 
            var epid = epid_example;  // string | The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. The Marketing API getMerchandisedProducts call and the Browse API getItem, getItemByLegacyId, and getItemsByItemGroup calls return the ePID of the product. You can also use the product_summary/search call in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=15032 Maximum: 1 Required: The call must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these) (optional) 
            var fieldgroups = fieldgroups_example;  // string | This field is a comma separated list of values that lets you control what is returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. EXTENDED - Returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS (optional) 
            var filter = filter_example;  // string | This field supports multiple field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50] You can also combine filters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50],sellers:{rpseller|bigSal} The following are the supported filters.

If offset is 0 and limit is 10, the call will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned, if offset is 10 and limit is 10, the call will retrieve items 11 thru 20 from the list of items returned. Valid Values: 0-10,000 (inclusive) Default: 0 Maximum number of items returned: 10,000 (optional) 
            var q = q_example;  // string | A string consisting of one or more keywords that are used to search for items on eBay. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma (iphone,ipad), the query returns items that have iphone AND ipad. If the keywords are separated by a space (iphone&nbsp;ipad or iphone,&nbsp;ipad), the query returns items that have iphone OR ipad. Restriction: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field. Required: The call must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these) (optional) 
            var sort = sort_example;  // string | Specifies the order and the field name to use to sort the items. To sort in descending order use - before the field name. Currently, you can only sort by price (in ascending or descending order), or by distance (only applicable if the &quot;pickup&quot; filters are used, and only ascending order is supported). If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. The following are examples of using the sort query parameter. Sort Result &amp;sort=price Sorts by price in ascending order (lowest price first) &amp;sort=-price Sorts by price in descending order (highest price first) &amp;sort=distance Sorts by distance in ascending order (shortest distance first) Default: ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/SortField.html (optional)
